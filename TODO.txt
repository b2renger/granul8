- adsr, volume, pan, arpegio etc. should all be customizable per instance and apply only to their instance.
- update transport bar to allow start loop point and end loop point editing
- use pan and allow to randomize pan
- we should have a master volume per layer
- we need to review the bpm sync accross layers.
- we should also review the loop points and the quantization so that everything stays in rythm over time.
